Amazon EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is probably one of AWS's most well known services.  In just minutes,
virtual machines can be configured, booted up, and running.  The user picks the type of image, 
resources, and sets up network, security groups, tenancy, etc details.  The user is charged only for
the resources consumed (so much per hour per resource type - varies per machine/resource configuration).
From simple side projects to medium-sized business applications, it can be very convenient to get up 
and running without worrying with the hassles of managing hardware (and cheaper due to scaling if there
are long periods of low resource consumption).
